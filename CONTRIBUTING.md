> Things to consider for contributing

## Modules

When submitting a new module PR, the following file structure needs to be adhered to

```
modules/
	%module_name%/
		BEM.scss
		SMACSS.scss
		...
```



## Commits

This project follows the conventional commits format for commit messages. This allows for automatically generated release notes. See more about the conventional commit standard [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).



If you are not used to this style of commit messages or need a refresher of the different **types** (feat, fix, refactor, etc.) I strongly recommend using [commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/). There's even a VSCode [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KnisterPeter.vscode-commitizen)!



## Vue Code Style

It is strongly recommended to read and understand Vue's own [style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/). This will ensure a more readable codebase and make it easier for all who wish to contribute to this project.
